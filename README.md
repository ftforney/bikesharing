 - The previous point aligns strongly with Male customers, while Female customers are more frequent between 4 - 8 hours.

 - Rides are most commonly taken between Monday - Friday.
 - The peak hours of riding are between 4 - 7 PM.
 - The low hours of riding are between 1 - 5 AM, which would be a great time for maintenance.

 - Male customers make up a majority of trips, and ride between 6 - 9 AM, and 4 - 7 PM.
 - Female customers are almost around the same times, riding between 7 - 9 AM, and 4 - 7 PM.

## Summary

This data and visualization gives us a lot of answers to potential questions, such as when is the best time to perform maintenance on bikes? What bike should be prioritized for maintenance? Which locations can we shift bikes away from to save costs?

We can see a majority of the user-base is Male, and subscribers mainly use the bikes. If there is any additional data I would include and potentially see correlations with are seeing the trends of data with weather data included.
